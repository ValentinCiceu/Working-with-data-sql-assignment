This is to explain some concepts:
I use a control point node to distribute the data to each model without having
to create multiple inteconnected to the links from the data source to the models.

I will be able to do multiple types of data tewaks and pass it to control point node

with the interactive decision tree, i'm choosing the highestlogworth value,
building this new model will allow me to manually choose the splits.

Reason on the impute node for the defalut value to be tree surrogate is
to configure the impute node to impute missing class values in observsations
from predicted values from a decision tree

In the default input method of impute node, I set to median, which means that 
the missing values will be replaces by the median. Median is less sensitive to 
extreme values than the mean or midrange options.also useful with replacing values
in skewed distributions


Using trsnaformation to address some issues with the data,
or example I will use the common log transformation to address with the skweness suh like
duration

For varbialbe selctor, only varialbes with high R-square are kept.
